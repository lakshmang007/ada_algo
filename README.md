# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization

An interactive web-based visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

## Features

- Interactive graph creation
- Drag and drop nodes to position them
- Create weighted edges between nodes
- Set start and end nodes
- Step-by-step visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Visual representation of the shortest path

## Live Demo

## How to Use

### Creating a Graph
1. Use the "Add Node" tool to place nodes on the canvas
2. Use the "Connect Nodes" tool to create edges between nodes
3. Set the weight for each edge using the weight input
4. Designate start and end nodes using the respective tools

### Running the Algorithm
1. Switch to "Run Algorithm" mode
2. Click "Start" to begin the visualization
3. Watch as the algorithm explores the graph
4. See the final shortest path highlighted

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Canvas API for rendering
